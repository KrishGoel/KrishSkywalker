👋 Sup adios, I'm a full-time aspiring engineering student at 🏫 Sanskriti School, New Delhi.

I’m currently learning how to 🤖 teach machines to think autonomously and working on a 👗 smart streetwear fashion startup.

Bricolage is my thing and I spent 🍹 my last 2 summers 🎓 teaching younger students the intricacies of coding. Looking at the bigger picture, I aspire to develop ⚡ ‘smarter’ energy sources and solve 🌏🍃 global-ecological problems with 💻 the lines I type.
