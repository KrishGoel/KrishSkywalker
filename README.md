ðŸ‘‹ Sup adios, I'm a full-time aspiring engineering student at [Sanskriti School, New Delhi](http://sanskritischool.edu.in).

Iâ€™m currently learning how to the teach machines to think autonomously and working on a smart streetwear fashion startup [@VKYD](https://github.com/VKYD).

Bricolage is my thing and I spent my last 2 summers teaching younger students the intricacies of coding. Looking at the bigger picture, I aspire to develop â€˜smarterâ€™ energy sources and solve global-ecological problems with the lines I type.

You can find out more about me on my [portfolio page](http://krishgoel.com) ðŸ¤˜
